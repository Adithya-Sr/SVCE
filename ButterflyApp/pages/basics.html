            <p>
              A butterfly’s life begins with the egg stage which is laid on the
              stems and leaves of plants followed by the active feeding stage
              known as the caterpillar (larva) where it keeps shedding its skin
              as it grows and emerges several thousand times bigger before it
              goes into its resting stage called the pupa (chrysalis).
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, it spins an enclosure around itself and sleeps until it
              develops the adult features and transforms itself into a big,
              beautiful, flying imago (adult).

              The difference between a butterfly and a moth lies in the
              antennae, colour, resting stance, period of activity and pupa.
              While butterflies have club-shaped antennae, appear brighter in
              colour, rest with their wings held together, active during the day
              with the pupa being a chrysalis which clings to a branch for
              support; moths have feathery antennae, usually dull in appearance,
              rest with their wings open, active during the night with the pupa
              being a cocoon on the ground. Club-shaped antennae Feather

              India serves as a host to 1800 species of butterflies which are

            </h2>
            <p class="dive-p">
              Named after their way of flight, the ‘Skippers’ or Hesperiidae are
              a family which have certain characteristics resembling moths.
              Darts, Awls, and Swifts are categorised under this family.
            </p>
            <p class="dive-p">
              The second-largest family is Lycaenidae or the ‘Blues and coppers’
              or ‘Gossamer-winged butterflies’ has species like Grass Jewel,
              Gram Blue and Sunbeam
            </p>
            <p class="dive-p">
              The ‘Brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies’ or
              Nymphalidae is the largest family. They have forelegs which are
              never fully developed or functional as in the other families. The
              popular species include Tigers, Crows and Bushbrowns
            </p>
            <p class="dive-p">
              The ‘Whites and yellows’ or Pieridae is a large family consisting
              of butterflies that have white, yellow, orange or sulphur
              colouration. Emigrants, Pioneers and Grass Yellows fall under this
              family
            </p>
            <p class="dive-p">
              The Papilionidae or ‘Swallowtail’ family are the largest (in size)
              and of attractive colours such as the Limes, the Mormons and the
              Roses. Most of them have tailed hind wings and hence the name

              Although a majority of butterflies visit flowers for their nectar
              to obtain sugars for energy, there is a minority of butterflies
              which feed on rotting fruits, pollen, dead and decaying matter,
              dung, tree sap and other organic material. The mud-puddling
              behaviour can be seen in species like the Common Emigrant, Common
              Lime and Common Crow where the butterflies of the same or
              different species feed gregariously on wet soil, to obtain the
              minerals, salt and nutrients from the soil vital for reproduction
            </h2>
            <p class="dive-txt">
              Some other species orient themselves together for basking while
              some are choosy in their perches and use the same perch for
              basking. Many species exhibit polymorphisms such as sexual
              dimorphism, mimicry (defense mechanism) and seasonal polyphenism
              (dry season and wet season forms). Some are capable of making
              clicking sounds and have a good vision and hearing ability

            <h2 class="dive-txt">
              Butterflies are very fragile, almost defenseless and vulnerable
              creatures. They fall prey to spiders, insects, frogs, reptiles,
              birds and small mammals They have developed various strategies to
              protect themselves from these predators. Some caterpillars eat
              plants that are poisonous to their predators but can sequester the
              toxins themselves since they have better digestive mechanisms
              (automimicry)
            </h2>
            <h2 class="dive-txt">
              The colours of the caterpillar and the adult butterflies also play
              a major role in protection by camouflaging and displaying bright
              and warning colours (aposematism). Many caterpillars blend with
              the colours of their host plants while others look like bird
              droppings (example: Common Mormon). The hairy structures on the
              larval body also protect them. The adults also have colours that
              blend with their environment as in the case of Common Evening
              Brown and Common Bushbrown
